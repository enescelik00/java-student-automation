# Java Student Automation System

This project is a simple student automation system developed in Java.
It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, role-based user management,
and basic GUI-based interactions.

The system supports different user roles such as students, teachers, and administrators.

## Features

### User Roles
- **Student**
- **Teacher**
- **Administrator (Idare)**

## Project Structure

- `src/` – Java source files
- `userdata.txt` – File-based user data storage

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
3. Run the main class (`OgrenciIsleriOtomasyonu.java` or `TestFrame.java`).
4. Use the login screen to access different roles.
